# TODO API using DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK

### Features: 

* django-notifications to notify admin when a user creates a task
* Authentication not implemented yet
* DB: postgres

### Set Up:

* Anaconda must be installed
* conda create -n <environment-name> --file req.txt
* requirements.txt file also attached for installation using pip
* change values in DATABASES array in todoapi/settings.py

##### Work on the API is not complete. I am still working on understanding how django works :)
